Code used and developed for this project comprises three main components:

1) Bayesian statistical model
2) CLIRUN hydrological model
3) Stochastic dynamic program (SDP)


Step 1: Run Bayeisan statistical model analysis

The code for the Bayesian statistical model is contained in the folder BMA_code. 
To complete this analysis the following steps are needed:

	1) Run pre_process_BMA.m in MATLAB. This takes historical and projected climate data from the file Input/Mombasa_TandP.mat and formats it to prepare for the Bayeisan analysis.

	2) Run MomUni_P.R and MomUni_T.R scripts using R. These scripts do batch analysis of the Bayesian modeling for each virtual future observation of T and P. To do this, they call the script REA.Gibbs.r, which was provided by Claudia Tebaldi, based on her
